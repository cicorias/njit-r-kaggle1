## Setup Python Jupyter Notebooks

1. Make sure you have Python installed and it's 3.7.5 or higher. Not sure if 3.8 will work if we end up using TensorFlow 2.0
1. Then install Poetry https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
1. Once installed, clone this repo
1. From the repo directory run `poetry shell`
1. Then run `poetry install` - you only need to do this if any packages are added and on first run
1. Then run `./lab.sh` to start the notebook if under Ubuntu -- or
1. Just run `jupyter lab --port=8002`  - or leave off the port flag if you want jupyter to choose.
